Scaling and Centering of Matrix-like Objects
Description
scale is generic function whose default method centers and/or scales the columns of a numeric matrix. 

Usage
scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

Arguments
x a numeric matrix(like object). 
center either a logical value or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns of x. 
scale either a logical value or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns of x. 

Details
The value of center determines how column centering is performed. If center is a numeric vector with length equal to the number of columns of x, then each column of x has the corresponding value from center subtracted from it. If center is TRUE then centering is done by subtracting the column means (omitting NAs) of x from their corresponding columns, and if center is FALSE, no centering is done. 

The value of scale determines how column scaling is performed (after centering). If scale is a numeric vector with length equal to the number of columns of x, then each column of x is divided by the corresponding value from scale. If scale is TRUE then scaling is done by dividing the (centered) columns of x by their root-mean-square, and if scale is FALSE, no scaling is done. 

The root-mean-square for a column is obtained by computing the square-root of the sum-of-squares of the non-missing values in the column divided by the number of non-missing values minus one. 

Value
For scale.default, the centered, scaled matrix. The numeric centering and scalings used (if any) are returned as attributes "scaled:center" and "scaled:scale"

x <- matrix(1:10, ncol=2)
(centered.x <- scale(x, scale=FALSE))
cov(centered.scaled.x <- scale(x))# all 1
